# 🌐 Personal Portfolio — Built with Astro

This is my personal portfolio site, built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with performance, minimal JavaScript, and modern web best practices in mind.

## 🚀 Why Astro?

Astro allows me to ship less client-side JavaScript by default, which results in:

- ⚡ **Blazing-fast performance**
- 🧼 **Cleaner, more maintainable code**
- 📱 **Better SEO and accessibility**
- 🧠 **Developer-first experience with great DX**

## 🎯 Goal

Create a portfolio that reflects my work as a web developer, prioritizing performance and simplicity without sacrificing design or interactivity when needed.
